# Pizza Invaders

This is a simple sample project builded for practice purposes using Python's pygame module  

## Required Dependencies  

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8.10 or higher
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) 2.0.3 or higher  

**NOTE:** This hasn't been tested with older versions of python nor pygame, so I can't guarantee 100% compatibility.  
This project should work with anything that's also compatible with Python3 and Pygame.  

## Getting Started

While in the game folder, just run the following command into your CLI:  

`python3 main.py`
